The purpose of this project is to explain how to make code testable.

This project is a simple application which is supposed to send greetings to users 
on International Man's or Women's Day depending on the gender of the person.

Unfortunately, it does not work as expected. 
It does not send greetings at all.

There are even more problems in the code, like performance and duplications.
It's not the most beautiful one but similar to what happens sometimes in legacy software.

Let's fix the errors and write unit tests.

We will use Mockito library for mocking.
